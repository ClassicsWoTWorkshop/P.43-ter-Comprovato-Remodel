# **IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE DOWNLOADING:**
Since the .wotmod size for this mod is greater than 100 mb (which requires the use of Git LFS), the .wotmod required for install has been included in a compressed .zip file. Therefore, I would highly suggest downloading [this .zip file itself](ClassicsWoTWorkshop-P.43-ter-Comprovato-Remodel-v1.0-[1.7.0.2].zip) , rather than downloading the master zip from this repo (as I am not sure whether the master zip compression will cause issues).

To install, drag the .wotmod file included in the aforementioned .zip file to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>. 

> (Example: `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.7.0.2`)
