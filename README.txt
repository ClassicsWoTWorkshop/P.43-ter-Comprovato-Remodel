==========================================

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTICE:

Due to the new caching feature introduced in Update 1.27.1, remodels will sometimes fail to appear in-game, even if installed correctly.

If the remodel does not show up in-game (assuming you have installed it correctly), go to your WoT install directory (by default: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks_EU\) and delete the "data.wgpdc" file (may be displayed without file extension, i.e. just a file named "data"). Alternatively, clear your game cache in WGC, by performing the "Check and Repair" function (under Game Settings).
